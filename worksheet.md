# Task 0

Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
      Github and BitBucket two examples of hosted version control platforms we can use to push projects and code to, and revise past code. Github is better (Subjective)
  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
      Matthew Robberts
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
      Jon Mountjoy
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
      Dave Pearce
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
      Both projects are somewhat active. Project A's last commit was July 9 of this year but just data, suggesting only the data is being updated and no improvemnets to the actual platform as a whole. while repo b has frequent commits, the most recent one being on Jul 25.
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
      Repo 1 - 23 changes app.py
      Repo 2 - 696 changes build.num

      Note - when I run the git log func, there is a 7757 number with no file name attached - this may be the total?

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

~~~~~
Red vs. Blue

Done
